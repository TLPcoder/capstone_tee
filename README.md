project:
    - A website when users can do two things. First create auctions and second bid on auctions. A member of a country club can create an auction where users will have the ability to bid on a round of golf at a specific country club. The member will be able to make so extra cash on the side and the user will be able to play country clubs they only ever dreamed of.

    - who uses it
        - Member of country clubs who are looking to make an extra buck to maybe help pay for their membership.
        - every day golfer who cannot afford to be a member of a country club. Maybe a loved one will bid on a round of golf at a course the person has always wanted to play, possibly for their birthday.
        - Members of a country who want to play another country club but cant because they do not know anyone there.
        - Maybe country clubs themselves will use it to make money.
